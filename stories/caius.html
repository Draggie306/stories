                I woke up from my deep slumber from the buzzing alarm, warning me of the impending 9am supervision, after a hard day's revision in the Caius Library. My limbs felt like lead and my mind was still foggy from the late night before. I got out of bed, put on my clothes, and did a few early morning stretches - a shoulder roll, and some brief tensing, followed by opening the window to the typical winter view outside - crisp, with a light lace-like frost on the grass.

                It was then I felt it. Or rather, smelt it. The sugary vanilla extract scent drifting up from the caf√© below that I knew too well, from the middle-class workers having their breakfast before their typical nine-to-five. It was then, feeling that scent wafted towards me, I knew it would be a good day.
